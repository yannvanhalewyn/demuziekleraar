# De Muziekleraar

De muziekleraar is a website I designed and built for a music school.

## Development

This site is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), exported to static pages
hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

To setup clone the repo and run:

```bash
yarn
```

To start the dev server run:

``` sh
yarn dev
```

This will start the next.js dev server.

## Deploy

This site is deployed on Netlify. To deploy simply push to the master branch of
this repo.
